# Fast Fashion vs. Sustainable Consumption: A Battle Between Market Share, Environmental Impact, and Customer Sentiment

## Introduction:

Fashion. When you think of that word, many fragmented notions make the whole; fast, high, sustainable, vintage, avant-garde, these complex types come together to create what we know in this modern age. Though, no matter where or how you consume fashion, one thing remains the same: the waste it produces has increased significantly, and will continue to increase unless we can identify why it is increasing. UNEP (UN Environment Program) researchers found in their research that, “the number of times a garment is worn has declined by around 36% in 15 years,” aligning almost perfectly to the growth of fast fashion, with SHEIN, the main fast fashion producer, beginning production in 2008. This begins to form a question in our head, “how much has fast fashion truly contributed to textile waste,” and if that didn’t form in your head, then you do not grasp how slippery of a slope the propagation of unsustainable consumption really is.

This has been a rapidly growing gripe in my personal life. As someone who preaches sustainable consumption, I wear my clothes until I physically can’t, and if they fall out of my wear-rotation, I swiftly donate them or sell them. Outside of my professional life, I find that clothing is the purest form of self-expression, and this causes me to become hyper-aware of what people in my life are wearing. Though it can be fun to know what brands people lean to, and what clothing pieces would fit right in in their closet, I find seeing someone with a new, low-quality shirt every time I see them irritates me. Knowing that given time, that shirt will end in the landfill. Each time that irritation hit my brain, the same question rang throughout my day, “is this really normalized now?” So, I set out to answer that.

## The Main Questions to Answer:

I began with refining my question, “is this really normalized now?” is not a good question to answer with data. Just as fashion exists in shards, I found that tackling such a large problem will require splitting my questions-to-answer into segments as well. So, I used some set theory to divide and conquer. 

First, intersection; what do fast fashion and sustainable labels have in common?

### Primary Research Question:



Does the price-quality relationship in pieces of clothing correlate with actual consumer satisfaction and environmental impact, and how do consumer perceptions align with measurable sustainability metrics across fast fashion versus sustainable brands?

### Secondary Questions:

What is the true cost-per-wear ratio between fast fashion and sustainable alternatives?
How does consumer sentiment in reviews correlate with objective quality metrics?
Do sustainability claims in marketing align with actual material composition and consumer durability experiences?
What patterns emerge in consumer behavior when price, quality, and environmental impact are analyzed together?
